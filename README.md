# üìà Financial Correlation & Risk Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built with **Streamlit** to analyze cross-asset correlations, assess risk, and optimize portfolios using historical market data. It is powered by **Supabase** for user authentication and persistent group management, and yfinance for live financial data analysis.

## üöÄ Features

### ‚úÖ Core Capabilities

- **User-Specific Private Group** - Each user can save and manage named stock groups (e.g., "Tech Stocks", "China Exposure") tied to their account which will not be accessible to the public
- **Dynamic Ticker Input** ‚Äì Analyse any stocks (Yahoo Finance-compatible ticker)
- **Flexible Date Range Control** ‚Äì Analyze as far back as 2010 or narrow to recent periods
- **Customizable Return Calculations** ‚Äì Compare raw price changes vs percent changes, daily/monthly/yearly
- **Overlap Handling** ‚Äì Choose between overlapping and non-overlapping return windows for YoY analysis
- **Rolling Correlation** ‚Äì Analyze how correlation between any stock pair changes over time
- **Correlation Matrix Analysis** ‚Äì Pearson, Kendall, Spearman options with one-click CSV download
- **Top Correlation Highlights** ‚Äì Automatically detect top positive, negative, and strongest correlation pairs
- **Risk Metrics** ‚Äì Compute VaR, CVaR, and Sharpe ratios per asset (with Riskfolio)
- **Portfolio Optimization** ‚Äì Construct a max Sharpe ratio portfolio and view allocation weights
- **Rebalancing Simulation** ‚Äì Visualize cumulative return, drawdown, and monthly rebalanced performance
- **Secure Login & Logout Flow** ‚Äì Seamlessly re-authenticate via session tokens

## üß† Use Cases

- Easily organize private groups of tickers for repeated analysis
- Construct and analyze diversified, low-correlation investment portfolios
- Identify highly correlated assets to reduce redundancy and improve risk-adjusted returns
- Compare market regimes using different correlation methods (Pearson, Kendall, Spearman)
- Test impact of overlapping vs non-overlapping return windows on statistical accuracy
- Evaluate risk across assets with standardized metrics like VaR, CVaR, and Sharpe
- Optimize asset allocations to maximize Sharpe ratio using historical returns
- Track how relationships between assets evolve over time via rolling correlation
- Assess data sufficiency and reliability for newly listed or delisted tickers
- Benchmark performance against monthly rebalanced portfolio simulations

## üì¶ Installation

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you encounter solver issues with Riskfolio optimization, also install:

```bash
pip install cvxopt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

### üñ• Streamlit Web App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8501`
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure .streamlit/secrets.toml includes your Supabase project config
```bash
[supabase]
url = "https://your-project-id.supabase.co"
key = "your-anon-key"
```

---

### üìù Excel Backtesting
All correlation matrix for `absolute/relative` and `daily/monthly/yearly` calculated on Streamlit app.py **matches** Excel's backtesting.

---

### üìì Jupyter Notebook

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The Jupyter notebook is not updated as it is only used for experimental purposes. Refer to Streamlit app.py for the most up to date code logic and features.

Open:

```bash
jupyter notebook correlation_analysis.ipynb
```

Manually adjust variables for analysis and code for testing.
